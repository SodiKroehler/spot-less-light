McClelland opposed the investment and has said she would not make new investments in foreign holdings. Garrity worked with Republican lawmakers to introduce a bill that would create Keystone Saves, a statewide retirement plan option for employers who otherwise canâ€™t afford to offer one. McClelland opposes it and has called it a  â€œprivatized, unregulated, self-directed, non-employer sponsored â€˜retirement plan.â€™â€ Garrity supports former President Donald Trump, spoke at a January 2021 rally organized to encourage state lawmakers to decertify the 2020 election results, and celebrated the impending overturn of Roe v.

The treasurer manages state dollars, administers tax-free savings programs, and has a board seat on Pennsylvaniaâ€™s two public sector pension funds. Garrity announced a few days after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that she purchased an additional $20 million in Israel Bonds. McClelland opposed the investment and has said she would not make new investments in foreign holdings. Garrity worked with Republican lawmakers to introduce a bill that would create Keystone Saves, a statewide retirement plan option for employers who otherwise canâ€™t afford to offer one. McClelland opposes it and has called it a  â€œprivatized, unregulated, self-directed, non-employer sponsored â€˜retirement plan.â€™â€ Garrity supports former President Donald Trump, spoke at a January 2021 rally organized to encourage state lawmakers to decertify the 2020 election results, and celebrated the impending overturn of Roe v. Wade in a 2022 Facebook post. McClelland was endorsed by then-Vice President Joe Biden during a previous run and has described herself as pro-choice.

Garrity announced a few days after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that she purchased an additional $20 million in Israel Bonds. McClelland opposed the investment and has said she would not make new investments in foreign holdings. Garrity worked with Republican lawmakers to introduce a bill that would create Keystone Saves, a statewide retirement plan option for employers who otherwise canâ€™t afford to offer one. McClelland opposes it and has called it a  â€œprivatized, unregulated, self-directed, non-employer sponsored â€˜retirement plan.â€™â€ Garrity supports former President Donald Trump, spoke at a January 2021 rally organized to encourage state lawmakers to decertify the 2020 election results, and celebrated the impending overturn of Roe v. Wade in a 2022 Facebook post. McClelland was endorsed by then-Vice President Joe Biden during a previous run and has described herself as pro-choice.

Paper applications are also available for download in Spanish and Chinese, in addition to English. Applications must be received by your county election board by 5 p.m. on October 29 for the November 5 general election. Once approved, you will receive your ballot, which you must then complete. Each mail ballot comes with instructions that voters must read carefully. The best way to ensure your vote counts is to follow the instructions on your mail ballot, especially when it comes to correctly dating your ballot. You must return your own ballot, unless you have officially ""https://www.pa.gov/content/dam/copapwp-pagov/en/vote/resources/documents-and-forms/Authorize-Designated-Agent-for-Mail-in-or-Absentee-Ballot.pdf"" designated another person to do so on your behalf. There are several methods for returning your ballot, but the most important thing to remember is that your county election board must receive your ballot by 8 p.m. on Election Day. If youâ€™re returning your ballot in person or using a drop box, you must use a location in your county. If you deliver your ballot to another county, it wonâ€™t be counted.

The treasurer manages state dollars, administers tax-free savings programs, and has a board seat on Pennsylvaniaâ€™s two public sector pension funds. Garrity announced a few days after the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas that she purchased an additional $20 million in Israel Bonds. McClelland opposed the investment and has said she would not make new investments in foreign holdings. Garrity worked with Republican lawmakers to introduce a bill that would create Keystone Saves, a statewide retirement plan option for employers who otherwise canâ€™t afford to offer one. McClelland opposes it and has called it a  â€œprivatized, unregulated, self-directed, non-employer sponsored â€˜retirement plan.â€™â€ Garrity supports former President Donald Trump, spoke at a January 2021 rally organized to encourage state lawmakers to decertify the 2020 election results, and celebrated the impending overturn of Roe v. Wade in a 2022 Facebook post. McClelland was endorsed by then-Vice President Joe Biden during a previous run and has described herself as pro-choice.
